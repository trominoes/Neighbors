# Neighbors
'Neighbors' is a word game, designed and created in the style of NYT Games. I used Stanford's GloVe word embedding model to build the game's vocabulary and a dictionary of neighbors for all words.

Visit the [methodology page](https://trominoes.github.io/neighbors/methodology/) or the ['about' section](https://trominoes.github.io/neighbors/) for a more complete description of 'Neighbors'.

## Structure
`index.html` is the main page, while the `static` folder contains CSS files, `functions.js`, and the JSON files used to store word lists.
